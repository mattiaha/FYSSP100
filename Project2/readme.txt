These are the python scripts used to create the results for the second part of the machine learning self-study course at UiO.
make.py and makewo.py creates the simulations used. The only difference between the two image sets are the figure sizes defined in these two scripts.
crop1.py is used to cut off the axes of the large images, crop2.py is used to cut off the axes of the small images.
tf.py is used to train the first model using the set of large images. tf2.py is used to train the second model on the small images.
The first model is too large to be uploaded on to github, same goes for the corresponding images. However, the second model and the set of small images is available.
